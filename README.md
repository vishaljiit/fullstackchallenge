### Problem Statement: Find My Feast üçΩÔ∏è 

John is a passionate foodie who loves to explore new eateries around his city. However, every time he tries to find a restaurant serving his favourite food at a quality, he finds acceptable, he ends up spending hours browsing through endless online reviews and ratings. This often leaves him frustrated and struggling to make a choice. 

To solve John‚Äôs struggle, a **web application** named **‚ÄúFind My Feast‚Äù** is envisioned. The application will help food lovers like John to discover local restaurants that serve their favourite dishes, meeting their desired level of quality and rating. 

### Objective: 
To build a web application allowing users to search for restaurants serving their preferred food choices, filtered by a threshold rating provided by the user.  

### Example: 
As a user, John wants to find a restaurant that serves his favourite food, such as *Pizza*, with a minimum rating of **4 stars** or above. He enters his **food choice** (*Pizza*) and the **desired rating** (*4+*) into the application.  

The application fetches the list of restaurants meeting his criteria, based on the schema data. Within seconds, John gets a curated list: 

- **Pizza Hut (Bengaluru)** serves *Pizza* with a rating of *4*. 
- **Dominos (Bengaluru)** serves *Pizza* with a rating of *5*. 

John can quickly make his choice based on this information and enjoy a delightful meal without any hassle.
